# ColabMolecularEvolution
A collection of Google Colab notebooks for phylogenetic models implemented in [MolecularEvolution.jl](https://github.com/MurrellGroup/MolecularEvolution.jl) so you can test our models in the cloud.

# Available notebooks:
### FUBAR - a fast Bayesian approach for identifying sites under pervasive positive or purifying selection

# Instructions
Google Colab usually runs python, so these all require three initial steps to install Julia, and switch to using the Julia kernel. The specific instructions are at the top of each notebook.
